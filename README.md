# Synesthesia Wear

> Making sound visible: A wearable to detect environmental sounds and provide sensory feedback.

---

## 📖 Project Overview
**Synesthesia Wear** is a wearable device designed to **detect specific environmental sounds** (e.g., alarms, doorbells) and **alert the user** through sensory feedback like vibration. This enhances auditory awareness, especially for individuals in noisy environments or with hearing difficulties.
