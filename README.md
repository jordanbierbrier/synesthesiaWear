## 📖 Project Overview

**Synesthesia Wear** is a wearable device that improves users’ awareness of sounds within their environment.  
The system consists of three main components:

- **Bracelet:** A compact, wrist-worn device with built-in audio, Bluetooth, and vibration motor for customizable haptic feedback.
- **Android App:** An interactive mobile application where users can:
  - Assign haptic patterns to specific keywords or sounds.
  - Customize vibration settings
  - Enable or disable sounds dynamically
- **Sound Processing Module:** A machine learning and audio processing system that:
  - Detects specific environmental sounds (e.g., fire alarms, user names)
  - Uses techniques like filtering and feature extraction for accurate sound recognition

A **working prototype** successfully detected fire alarms and recognized several names in real-world environments.
